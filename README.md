# ArtaBot
**ArtaBot** is a fully modular bot for Discord, which means the user can enable/disable features to customize as they wish.  
This is a *self-hosted* bot, meaning the user has to host the bot themself.  
The default set of modules are:  
* Self Reminder  
* Mirror the entire text channel to your own channel  
* Music features (YouTube only) ***WIP***  
* Stream alerts (Twitch) ***WIP***
